# Android application template

Provides a ready to use project template.

* MVVM for UI layer, based on JetPack (a JetPack Compose implementation should come soon)
* Clean-architecture
* Reactive streams

## Usage

1. **create** a repo using the "Use this template" button on github
2. **clone** this repo:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:mrlem/my-fantastic-app.git
```
3. **import** the clone project in Android Studio

That's all!
From here, you can change the package in classes & build files (these are as simple as I could make them).

## TODO

* demonstrate transition manager
* fix package cleanarch -> arch
* use material design (should be integrated in arch): see https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md
